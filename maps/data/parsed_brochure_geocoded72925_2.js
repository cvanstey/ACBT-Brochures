Borrowing Afrocentric perspectives on placemaking and kinship, the women featured in the Atlantic City Board of Trade brochures become symbolic emblems of Black women creating space, opportunity, and futures for one another. These alternate forms of kinship—rooted in education and entrepreneurship—are provided by businesswomen such as Madame Sara Alexander and Annie M. Malone. Although some of the “bathing beauties” remain unnamed, each woman functions as a local icon, embodying the city’s ambitions for tourism, growth, and cultural prominence through a visual language centered on female empowerment. Whether selected or staged by the ACBT, these women represent a civic ideal of beauty, hospitality, and modern femininity. Their inclusion reclaims visibility in a marketplace historically monopolized by white aesthetics, long held as the normative ideal. Although the realities of their lives remain largely undocumented, the captions and content surrounding them suggest deliberate negotiations of race, class, and identity. Their presence signals a strategic juxtaposition—a refusal to be marginalized—that reconfigures who is seen, how women are defined, and how beauty is commodified.
