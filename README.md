# Atlantic City Board of Trade Brochures Project

## Overview
This project digitizes and analyzes historic African American tourism brochures produced by the Atlantic City Board of Trade during the 1930s‚Äì1940s. These brochures highlight businesses, cultural institutions, and leisure sites located primarily in what was known as the Northside of Atlantic City, NJ.

While most of the featured businesses are Black-owned, a small percentage of Asian and Jewish businesses also appear, having purchased advertising space. Not all advertised locations are in Atlantic City‚Äîsome are in Pleasantville, Ocean City, Absecon, Philadelphia, or even Florida.

These materials challenge assumptions and invite deeper exploration. Rather than summarize all findings here, we encourage you to:

Tour the project
Explore the dataset
Suggest refinements
Apply your critical data skills

Be part of a collaborative effort to center overlooked histories through open science and digital tools.
