## üìÇ Image Hosting and Integration via Dropbox

This project integrates historical images into a QGIS-based interactive map. Images are hosted on Dropbox and referenced in the map via public URLs generated by a Python script.
-To conserve space, only unique images are displayed. This means that if the same image appears multiple times in the brochures, it represents all the images across the catalog of brochures. 
-These images are also not ideal for print.

### üîó Purpose

Images from scanned brochures and archival sources are stored in Dropbox and linked to spatial data (CSV/GeoJSON) so they can be displayed as popups in QGIS. This allows viewers to explore the visual archive alongside location-based data.

### üß∞ Workflow Overview

1. **Images** are uploaded to a specific Dropbox folder (e.g., `/ACBT/images/`).
2. A **Python script** connects to Dropbox, lists all files in the folder, and generates public URLs using the Dropbox API.
3. The URLs are converted to a `?raw=1` format so they can be embedded directly in web popups or used by mapping tools.
4. The script outputs a CSV file containing the filenames and public URLs.
5. This CSV is joined with geospatial data and loaded into **QGIS**.
6. In QGIS, these URLs are used in popups, e.g., to display archival advertisements, portraits, or event photos.

### üêç Python Script

The script uses the Dropbox Python SDK to:

- Authenticate using an access token
- Retrieve or create shared links
- Format the links as direct-access (`?raw=1`)
- Output a CSV with filename and URL

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This requires a Dropbox API access token. You can create one at [Dropbox Developer Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps).

### üó∫Ô∏è QGIS Integration

- The image URLs are added as a column (e.g., `image_url`) in the main data CSV.
- In QGIS, the layer is configured to show images in HTML popups using expressions like:

```html
<img src="[Image_URL]" width="300"/>
