### ðŸ§ª Methods

This project combines computational methods with archival critique to recover and reinterpret mid-20th-century African American tourism materialsâ€”specifically brochures produced by the Atlantic City Board of Trade from the 1930s to 1950s. These fragile and visually complex documents were never meant to be data, but they offer a powerful window into the spatial and cultural history of segregation-era leisure and labor.

### 1. Document Processing & OCR

Each brochure was scanned as high-resolution images, then processed using Python and open-source tools:

- **Image Preprocessing**: Pages are split and enhanced using PIL and OpenCV to isolate columns, crop images, and improve legibility.
- **Optical Character Recognition**: Tesseract OCR extracts textual content. Custom regex rules group names, titles, addresses, and phone numbers, reconstructing business entries from noisy data.
- **Image Region Detection**: Graphic elements such as ads and portraits are identified and saved as individual image files with metadata (e.g., source page, dimensions).

### 2. Data Structuring

The extracted data is normalized into a structured format for CSV export and mapping:

- **Fields include**: Business name, proprietor(s), address, phone number, brochure year, industry type, image references, and OCR confidence scores.
- **Named Entity Linking** is manually supported to identify repeated individuals or businesses across years.

### 3. Geospatial Mapping

To map historical addresses:

- **Geocoding** is done via manual lookup, historical maps, and approximate placement when exact locations are unknown.
- A **1940 georeferenced basemap** is used in QGIS and Folium to provide historical spatial context.
- Businesses without geolocation are grouped in image galleries for visual browsing.

### 4. Critical Archival Practice

This is not a neutral data pipeline. The materials are situated in a deeply racialized past, and the methods acknowledge that:

- **Visual analysis** attends to gazes, smiles, and posture in portraitsâ€”questioning who is meant to be seen, and how.
- **Textual silences**â€”missing names, ambiguous addressesâ€”are treated as meaningful, not errors.
- **Metadata ethics** are observed: no biometric tagging, no AI-generated inferences about faces or intentions.
- **Archival theory** from Black studies and memory work informs decisions about what to extract, annotate, and display.

### 5. Limitations & Future Work

- OCR errors persist in heavily degraded scans.
- Not all addresses can be reliably geocoded.
- Image classification and industry tagging are in progress and may evolve with community input.

This methodological approach foregrounds **imperfection, improvisation, and interpretation**â€”treating archival recovery as both a technical and ethical act.
